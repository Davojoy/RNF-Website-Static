              <p>
                While we organize our work into these four thematic areas, our
                approach is fundamentally integrated. We recognize that
                education, health, empowerment, and community engagement are
                deeply interconnected, and addressing one area in isolation is
                not sufficient.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our programs often span multiple thematic areas, creating
                comprehensive support systems for girls. For example, our school
                retention program includes not only educational support (fees,
                supplies) but also health components (sanitary products,
                reproductive health education), empowerment elements (life
                skills, peer support), and community engagement (parent
                workshops, teacher training).
              </p>

              <p>
                This integrated approach allows us to address the complex,
                interconnected challenges facing teenage girls and create
                lasting, meaningful impact in their lives.
